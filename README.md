# Obesity Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the risk level of obesity based on individuals' lifestyle habits, physical conditions, and demographic data using various machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and correlations.
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical features, etc.)
- Train and evaluate multiple ML classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN).
- Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Interpret the results and identify the most influential features affecting obesity risk.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age, Gender, Height, Weight
- Eating habits (frequency of meals, consumption of high-calorie food, etc.)
- Physical activity and lifestyle patterns
- Smoking and alcohol consumption

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Results
The best-performing model was **[Model Name]**, achieving an accuracy of **[XX%]** on the test set. Feature importance analysis showed that **[Feature1]**, **[Feature2]**, and **[Feature3]** were the top predictors.
